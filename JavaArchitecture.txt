Class Loader SubSystems:
	Class Loaders:
		1. Bootstrap Class Loader. -> loads java's internal classes which are inside rt.jar(runtime.jar)
		2. Extension Class Loader. -> jre/lib/ext loads all .class files from the jars under this folder.
		3. Application Class Loader. -> classpath, -cp 
	Link:
		1. Verify -> looks at bitecode checks if it is compatible with jvm specs
		2. Prepare -> memory is allocated for class variables with default values,
		3. Resolve -> all symbolic refrences inside current class are resolved from symbolic to actual values.
	Initialize:
		anything inside static block are initialized, all values set for static variables are set from default values to the specified value.
Runtime Data Areas:
	
	Method		Heap 	Java 		Pc			native
	Area 				Stacks		Registers	method
												Stacks.
	
	Method Area:
		where metadata related to class are stored. Static variables, byte code.
		method area is called perm gen space aka method area , default 64 mb.
		XX:MaxPermSize
		java.lang.OutOfMemoryError:PermGen Space...
		java 8 - metaspace, now infinite.
	Heap Area:
		Object data is stored.
		objects, Arrays are created in the heap.
		-Xms -  min size, -Xmx - max size.
	PC Registers:
		Program Counter Registers.
		points to the next instruction for the thread.
	Java Stacks:
		contains stack frame(all info of that method i.e objects state) corresponding to current method execution per thread.
	Native method stack:
		similar to the java stack but for native methods.
Execution Engine:
	Interpreter:
		once data area is loaded i.e the current instruction to be executed is ready interpreter interprets the current instruction in the byte code and executes it, 
	JIT Compiler:
		helps execute similar instructions together i.e repeated instruction's machine code ready for execution.
	Hotspot Profiler:
		collects statistics about the hotspots which could be used by jit collector to insert machine code on the hotspots which gets repeated.
