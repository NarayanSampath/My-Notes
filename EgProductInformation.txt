APM - Application Performance Monitoring

dimensions of Monitoring:
	1. End - User Monitoring / Real User Monitoring.
	2. Application Topology Discovery / visualization.
	3. Business Transaction Monitoring.
	4. Application Component Deep Dive.
	5. IT Analytics.

SOA - Infrastructure:
	Service Oriented Architecture. (context: APM helps visualize SOA inter-dependencies)

Real User Monitoring - RUM
	We could get the following from RUM:
		Traffic Patterns,
		Geo Performance,
		Browsers, Devices and their usage stats,
		JavaScript Errors, 
	Dashboard:
		Traffic, 
		Device distribution
		Geo Performance
		active sessions
		apdex score
		response time 
		avg response time,
		top slow urls, 
		tier wise distribution
		which browsers are slow
	Layer Model gives the bare data on which the dashboard are generated
	
How does monitoring happen in the user side?
	server sends a javascript Beaconing Agent in the HTML Response,
	Now the eg js agent fires asyncronously
	the beacon with performance data is sent by the js Agent to the collector
	RUM collector stores the performance beacon which is pulled by eg agent which is processed by eGManager,
	
	
	User -> User-Agent -> eGRum Collector -> eG Agent -> eG Manager -> Dashboard.
	
	ways to get performance metrics:
		Use Automatic container Injection,(the js in the http response)
		Use Automatic RUM instrumentation via JTM jar,
		Use manual injection for every common header or footer,
		Use manual injection for every page,
		Use Code Snippet to header page which is dynamically generated by servlet
		
	egrum.js -> is the javascript agent.

What does appDynamics Application Intelligence platform(Monitoring & Analytics Tool) do?
	1. Install app agents on applicaton server.
		1. Automatic discover app components (All JVMs, backend calls to message queues n databases)
		2. Automatically discover .net clr, php, python, node js applications and remote calls to all kinds of exit services. monitor c++ applications by agent SDKs
		3. Auto detect Business Transactions. Trace transaction flow throughout different tiers of the application.
		4. We can troubleshoot slow respnose times and errors, 
		5. we can also set health rules to make alerts on violations.
		6. compare metrics in the metrics browsers.
